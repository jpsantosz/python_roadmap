It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high, but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire, but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside I know

Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back then, should've bit your tongue
'Cause there's no turnin' back this path once it's begun
You're already on that list
Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss
Watch it all fallin' apart like this

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is
This is what you asked for

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

Heavy is the crown
Heavy is the
Heavy is the crown
